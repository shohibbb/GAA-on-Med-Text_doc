Future Research
===============

This project still has several limitations and opportunities for further development. Some potential directions for future research include:

1. **Utilizing More Complex Datasets**

   As explained on the Dataset page, the data used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. Future research can be expanded by using more complex datasets, including original data derived from patient descriptions. This approach is expected to test the model's robustness more thoroughly against real-world data.

2. **Exploring Other Algorithms**

   Many algorithms have been developed, especially for adversarial attacks on text data. New algorithms often improve upon previous ones. It is hoped that these algorithms can also be used to test various models.

Given the increasing use of AI, especially in the medical sector, there are high hopes that this technology can be used more safely and reliably, considering its direct impact on human life. Every study in this area makes an important contribution to maintaining the safety and sustainability of humanity.
